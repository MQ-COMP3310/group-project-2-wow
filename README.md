# Flask photo gallery

This codebase implements a basic photo web application using python and the flask framework. 

# Setup

To setup the basic website you will need to have the following installed:

- python3
- pip
- sqlite3

Pip is the package manager for Python.  You can install the remaining packages required for this task using pip. You will need to run the following:
To start you should create and activate a virtual environment:

 $ python -m venv env        # use `virtualenv env` for Python2, use `python3 ...` for Python3 on Linux & macOS   
 $ source env/bin/activate   # use `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows   
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 $ deactivate   

This web application has been tested on Python 3.10.13. If you have problems running this app, it is recommended that you downgrade to Python 3.10.13. Instructions on how to do this (on Mac with M1 chip) are here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62898911/how-to-downgrade-python-version-from-3-8-to-3-7-mac (replacing 3.7 with 3.10.13).

You will also need sqlite installed for the database backend.

# Initialising the database

You should first initialise the database as follows:
- python initialise_db.py

This should create an sqlite database under the instance directory. You can view the contents of the database using the sqlite command line interface as follows:

sqlite3 instance/photos.db   
> .schema    
CREATE TABLE photo (   
	id INTEGER NOT NULL,    
	name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,   
	caption VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,   
	file VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,   
	description VARCHAR(600),   
	PRIMARY KEY (id)  
);
